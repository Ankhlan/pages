<h2 id="the-gold-program-and-the-law-with-a-long-name">The Gold Program
and the Law with a Long Name</h2>
<p>Bank of Mongolia (BOM) purchased 17.8 tonnes of gold from domestic
producers in 2023. 2.7 trillion Mongolian tugrug (MNT) supplied into the
economy for its payment. To put it in perspective, Mongolia’s total GDP
was 68.8 trillion MNT and M1 money was 9.8 trillion MNT at the end of
2023.</p>
<p>This process of central bank buying started in 1991 after the
collapse of communism and a resulting shift to free-market. The country
was in shortage of foreign exchange as its export market collapsed with
USSR and the program was a way of a consolidating and developing gold
production for a source of hard currency. The Gold Program as it was
named was a goverment mandate promoted comprehensively with Ministry of
Mining, Ministry of Finance, and Development Bank of Mongolia. Bank of
Mongolia’s role was to purchase, to facilitate and to monetize the gold
and maintain it as a part of official foreign exchange reserve of the
country to finance export and support domestic currency. First Gold
Program ended in 1999 and subsequently the continued under the name of
Gold 2000, and Gold Program -2 which ended in 2020. However, even after
the goverment gold program has ended or in between the program, the
function of BOM as intermediary and exporter, its role as a market
maker, did not stop and only the amount gold purchased fluctuated
according to the support and expectations provided by the goverment.</p>
<p>In order to attract all domestic production, BOM offers international
market price of gold, the official London Bullion Market Association’s
(LBMA) previous day closing fix for silver and gold. There is no export
tax for selling gold to BOM. As per the Mongolian <em>Law on Mineral
Resources</em>, Article 47.3.2, gold sold to BOM is excempted from
additional 5 percent of mineral royalty tax on gold, and only liable for
base 5 percent royalty for any kind of mineral mined, effectively a 5
percent discount if sold to BOM. This is the only paragraph in an entire
legal framework that provides tax incentive for selling gold to BOM.
There is no export ban or a tax. It is fully legal for entities to
export gold out of the country and no legal obligation to sell to BOM.
There had been a tendency to apply periodic additional discounts and
incentives. The most recent one that lasted over 6 years from 2014 to
2020 offered 2.5 percent discount on base royalty. 5 percent premium on
price had also been offered during the COVID years of 2020 and 2021 to
stimulate and buffer the FX reserve.</p>
<p>The program effectively boosted the gold mining industry and resulted
in a major gold rush. Countless small scale mining licences had been
granted and without mature legal and enviromental framework, hordes if
people without permissions were mining with household tools and washing
the gold in rivers with mercury and other harmfull substances which
resulted in <em>The Law on Procedure for Compliance with the Law on the
Prohition of the Exploration and Use of Mineral Land in the Protection
Zone of All Lands of Rivers and Shoulder Flows, Water Reservoirs and
Forest</em>, also known as the Law with a Long Name. The enviromental
impact of the program was devastating that certain provinces stopped
issiung mining licenses and BOM started initiatives with Swiss
Development Agency to develop artisinal mining communities with licensed
and regulated operations.</p>
<h2 id="refined-gold-vs-monetary-gold">Refined Gold vs Monetary
Gold</h2>
<p>Gold mined in Mongolia, atleast over the last 5 years, has a finnesse
of an average of 85 percent of gold with silver and considered as quite
a high quality of gold doré (semi-pure natural alloy) within the
industry. It is common to have a doré of a finnesse of around 35
percent. The rest of the alloy may consist of silver and-or copper.
These ad-hoc shaped bullions are produced, numbered, and certified at
Mongolian Assay Office (MSO) in tight co-ordination with BOM.
Experienced artisans and goldsmiths can reach purity of 96 percent in
Mongolia but never 99.99 percent. Individuals who are mostly private
dealers and commercial banks bring thier bullions to BOM with its
certificate from the assay office to sell when they feel the price is
right where BOM already has recieved the list of bullions produced and
certified by the MSO. BOM pays the quoted price for the bullion’s gold
and silver content accordingly to the seller’s bank account and holds
the gold in its vaults.</p>
<p>Once in a while, BOM sends a shipment to LBMA certified refinery to
have its gold monetized. The refinery is contracted for every 5 years by
open public tendering process which would most likely be won by one of
the big three from Swiss, the PAMP, Argor-Heraeus, and Valcambi. The
refinery produces the LBMA standart 400 troy ounce gold bars with 999
purity, and stamps its seal and registration number which then is
considered monetized. The gold either in physical bars which is referred
as allocated gold and physically shipped or in unallocated electronic
form, A.K.A the paper gold, where we commonly denote as XAU, then can be
transfered into BOM’s account at its designated LBMA clearing bank in
London which could also further be transfered into vaults at Bank of
England. Currently, there are only 4 primary-clearing banks at the
London bullion market, HSBC, JPMorgan, ICBC Standart Bank, and UBS.</p>

Stable Money Supply: Sterilization vs Intervention</h2>
<h1 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h1>
<h2 id="on-sterilization">On Sterilization</h2>
<p>Sterilization is a central bank operation of draining money from the
economy in order to maintain a stable monetary base. The theoretical
foundation of sterilization is constructed on the Quantity Theory of
Money which states that the amount of money in circulation directly
affects the price level. Jean Bodin, in his seminal work "Les six livres
de la République", discussed the impact of changes in money supply on
price level and laid the early groundwork for the theory. David Hume
(1752), in his essay “Of Money”, argued that changes in money supply
only affect nominal variables such as nominal price level and will be
neutral on real variables like real output and real interest rates in
the long run, hence establishing the early ideas on the neutrality of
money. Irving Fisher (1911) had formulated the mathematical foundations
of Quantity Theory of Money with his equation of exchange: MV=PQ, where
“M” represents the money supply, “V” is the velocity of money, “P” for
the price level, and “T” the transaction volume. According to the
equation, when “V” and “T” are stable, an increase in the supply of
money directly increases the price. Milton Friedman (1963) further
contributed the empirical evidence of the theory and his famous phrase:
"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". Thus we know
that changes in money supply does not improve the real economic output
and only causes inflation and monetary authorities try to sterilize and
clean “M” from volatile capital flows by conducting open market
operations, buying and selling of assets against its own currency on the
financial markets.</p>
<p>During the Bretton Woods era, when gold was a currency, central banks
frequently engaged in sterilization to manage gold inflows and maintain
fixed exchange rates. Central banks conducted foreign exchange
interventions to maintain the peg to gold agreed by Bretton Woods and
sterilization was an essential mechanism for neutralizing the impact on
the domestic monetary base. The shift to floating exchange rates in the
1970s required more sophisticated sterilization techniques. Central
banks began using a mix of open market operations and reserve
requirements to manage the money supply and the study of its effects
were intensified. Calvo (1991), one of the most cited works on
sterilization, demonstrated a simple two period mathematical model of an
economy with domestic debt and money supply and showed that the
sterilization process, despite the obvious advantage of maintaining
stable monetary base in the short term, will eventually cause an
increase in the level of domestic debt and in the nominal interest rate,
attracting volatile capital inflows and creating a feedback loop which
through higher expected inflation creates more inflation. He argued that
monetary accommodation of capital inflows is preferred to sterilization
policy.</p>
<p>Empirical studies also show the diminishing benefits of
sterilization’s effectiveness. Spiegel and Kletzer (2004) studied the
impact of the sterilization cost on the decisions of inflation-targeting
central banks under exogenous capital inflows with intertemporal
government budget constraints. The authors used the small open economy
model for exchange rate determination and employed quarterly panel data
of 22 economies during the period of high capital inflows, from 1982 to
1992. Their theoretical result, also supported by empirical findings,
was that the countries did respond to the cost of sterilization under
high capital inflows and shifted towards a policy of accommodating the
capital inflows by adjusting the nominal exchange rate or expanding the
money supply. The authors also mentioned that the spread between the
domestic interest rates and international interest rates would contain
the sovereign risk premia and thus reduce the actual sterilization cost.
Sterilization is costly and central banks usually maintain sterilization
policies for only a limited duration of time. Edwards and Savastano
(1999) analyzed sterilization policies in Latin America using empirical
models and case studies. They highlighted that while some countries
effectively managed inflation through sterilization, others faced
increased financial instability. Similarly, Moreno (1996) compared the
sterilization efforts in Korea and Taiwan, finding that although these
measures helped manage inflation, they often resulted in higher debt due
to the costs of maintaining sterilization operations.</p>
<p>Ouyang, Rajan, and Willett (2007) examined the effectiveness of
sterilization in Asian economies, concluding that although sterilization
can release inflationary pressures, its long-term sustainability is
questionable because of the rising costs associated with these
operations. Montiel and Reinhart (2001) analyzed the capital flows to
emerging economies during the 1990s, found that while sterilization can
be effective in the short term, it creates risks of financial imbalances
and asset bubbles if used excessively.</p>
<p>Aizenman and Glick (2008) discussed the implications of sterilization
and foreign exchange reserve accumulation, arguing that while it helps
in managing inflation, it can lead to misalignments in exchange rates
and potential conflicts with other monetary policy objectives.
Emphasizing the idea that sterilization intrinsically leads to reserve
accumulation and hoarding reserves have additional opportunity costs
involved. Mohanty and Turner (2006) provided a detailed analysis on the
implications of reserve accumulation and sterilization, highlighting the
trade-offs involved, particularly the impact on domestic interest rates
and financial stability. Rodrik (2006) examined the broader economic
costs of maintaining large foreign exchange reserves and the associated
sterilization efforts, arguing that the opportunity cost of holding
reserves can significantly affect long-term economic growth. Fry (1993)
explored the fiscal implications of sterilization, particularly in
developing countries, noting that the costs of sterilization can cause
fiscal imbalances and undermine the credibility of central banks. The
BIS (2008) report provided a comprehensive overview of the implications
of reserve accumulation and sterilization on financial stability,
emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach to avoid the problems
of excessive sterilization.</p>
<p>The literature on sterilization highlights the complexity of using
this policy tool to manage inflation. Sterilization can be effective in
the short term. However, it carries significant risks beyond what first
meets the eye. Sterilization often leads to higher domestic interest
rates, attracting additional capital inflows, creating inflation
expectations, and amplifying the very problem it aims to solve. The
financial costs of sterilization operations can be substantial,
particularly for developing economies, including the interest payments
on debt securities used in open market operations. Moreover, longer run
sterilization efforts can lead to market imbalances, asset bubbles, and
excessive reserves accumulation undermining the long-term economic
stability.</p>
<p>Policymakers must carefully weigh the short-term benefits of
sterilization against its long-term costs and potential unintended
consequences. Since the shift to a market economy in 1991, the Bank of
Mongolia has consistently engaged in sterilization efforts. Primarily to
address the excess money supply generated from its domestic gold
purchase program and for sterilized foreign exchange interventions to
manage the volatile capital inflows of the current mining boom. Its
foreign exchange reserves recently reached all time highs, consequently,
the losses on interest payments for central bank bills it issues for the
purpose has ballooned. Despite these substantial costs, there has been
no study conducted in Mongolia to analyze the costs and benefits of this
policy. Are we paying the unnecessarily high inflation tax?</p>
